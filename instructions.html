                    <p>Dear participant <span class="js-pid pid"></span>, please read the instructions before the experiment.

                    <p>
Today we would be evaluating  the comparative performance of two different Copy-Paste Techniques. One, the traditional Ctrl C+V technique and the other a new technique called AutocomPaste .</p>
<p>For the evaluation purpose,you would be given a pre-chosen story that you would have to complete. A combination of a phrase, sentence and a paragraph would be given to you in order to complete this story.
We would be evaluating your response for using each of these two techniques for copy-paste in different scenarios. </p>
<p>First in order to complete the story , we would be giving a combination of phrase-sentence-paragraph to copy-paste within the same document.Second, in order to complete a different story, we would be giving a different combination of phrase - sentence - paragraph to copy-paste between different documents . However , it is important to point out that the order between  the Parent-Parent and Parent-Child scenario could be reversed in the actual experiment. Clear instructions on the screen would appear for the same. </p>
<p>You would be given three trials each for both the traditional Ctrl C+V and AutocomPaste technique.</p>
<p>We hope the above instructions are clear with respect to the experiment. However , we would request you to please follow the below  steps to navigate smoothly through the experiment :</p>
<p>1.Settle down and relax and log in to the experiment interface.</p>
<p>2.Fill up the pre-experiment form and read through the instructions page.</p>
<p>3.Now you are ready to start the experiment . Best of Luck!!</p>
<p>4.To start,You would be given an incomplete story. Your task would be to complete the story by Copy-pasting text using one of the two techniques(traditional Ctrl C+V and AutocomPaste ).</p>
<p>5.In order to complete the story ,a specific(textual) combination of a phrase - sentence â€“ paragraph would display on your screen . Your task is to copy-paste this combination either within the same document (Parent-Parent scenario) or between different documents(Parent-child scenario).</p>
 <p>6.We would only be providing  phrase - sentence - paragraph combinations that are easily understood . Hence you do not need to worry about your comprehension ability.</p>
<p>7.You would be given three trials each to copy-paste in order to complete the story with both the traditional Ctrl C/Ctrl V technique and with the new AutocomPaste technique.</p>
<p>8.The combination of phrase-sentence-paragraph would change every time you undertake  a subsequent trial within each technique.</p>    
<p>9.We request you to please turn your Hand phones to silent mode and refrain from interacting with other participants or other people during the experiment. We request you to please not talk any calls or messages during the experiment.</p>
<p>Thank you and Best of Luck!</p>
